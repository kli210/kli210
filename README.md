# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kelly, a former data maestro who danced my way from the biotechnology stage to the dazzling world of data science. Armed with a degree in biotech wizardry, I've swapped pipettes for Python, transforming into a data conjurer extraordinaire. When I'm not wrangling datasets or conjuring insights, you'll find me donning an apron and weaving culinary spells in the kitchen. From coding algorithms to crafting crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, my journey is an exhilarating fusion of data-driven discoveries and delectable experiments. Let's stir up a symphony of flavors and insights together!
