# Hey, I'm Kelly 👋
By day, I'm a data scientist, delving into the intricate world of data after a spell as a biotech whiz. Armed with a biotech degree, I've traded pipettes for Python, morphing into a data magician. Beyond my data-drenched pursuits, I'm on a mission to demystify open-source, engineer tech that empowers, and weave a close-knit community. With an insatiable hunger for learning, I'm always eager to expand my skill set and evolve as a person. When I'm not lost in coding spells or culinary experiments (I whip up both algorithms and crème brûlée), I'm concocting ways to fuse data-driven insights with gastronomic delights. So, let's stir up a symphony of flavors and insights together! 🚀🔮🍳

## About me
- 🧙‍♂️ Former biotech wizard now conjuring data magic as a passionate data scientist.
- 👨‍💻 On a mission to demystify open-source contributions, create tech that uplifts people, and build a tight-knit community.
- 🍳 When not coding Python or SQL, I'm mastering the art of cooking and baking.
